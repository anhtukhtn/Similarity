processing. preparing or putting through a prescribed procedure. the processing of newly arrived immigrants.the processing of ore to obtain minerals.
blowing. processing that involves blowing a gas. 
insufflation. (medicine) blowing air or medicated powder into the lungs (or into some other body cavity). 
data processing. (computer science) a series of operations on data by a computer in order to retrieve or transform or classify information. 
administrative data processing. business data processing. data processing in accounting or business management. 
automatic data processing. ADP. data processing by a computer. 
electronic data processing. EDP. automatic data processing by electronic means without the use of tabulating cards or punched tapes. 
integrated data processing. IDP. automatic data processing in which data acquisition and other stages or processing are integrated into a coherent system. 
data mining. data processing using sophisticated data search capabilities and statistical algorithms to discover patterns and correlations in large preexisting databases; a way to discover new meaning in data. 
distributed data processing. remote-access data processing. teleprocessing. data processing in which some of the functions are performed in different places and connected by transmission facilities. 
list processing. processing data that is given in the form of chained lists. 
multiprocessing. parallel processing. simultaneous processing by two or more processing units. 
operation. (computer science) data processing in which the result is completely specified by a rule (especially the processing that results from a single instruction). it can perform millions of operations per second.
access. memory access. (computer science) the operation of reading or writing stored information. 
disk access. memory access to the computer disk on which information is stored. 
asynchronous operation. operations that occur without a regular or predictable time relation to other events. 
auxiliary operation. off-line operation. a operation performed by off-line equipment not under the control of the central processing unit. 
boolean operation. binary operation. binary arithmetic operation. an operation that follows the rules of Boolean algebra; each operand and the result take one of two values. 
computer operation. machine operation. an elementary operation that a computer is designed and built to perform. 
floating-point operation. flop. an arithmetic operation performed on floating-point numbers. this computer can perform a million flops per second.
retrieval. (computer science) the operation of accessing information from the computer's memory. 
stovepiping. retrieval of information from unconnected databases; the situation that exists when it is necessary to climb out of one database in order to climb down into another; sometimes used for protection against wandering hackers. 
storage. (computer science) the process of storing information in a computer memory or on a magnetic tape or disk. 
fragmentation. (computer science) the condition of a file that is broken up and stored in many different locations on a magnetic disk. fragmentation slows system performance because it takes extra time to locate and assemble the parts of the fragmented file.
concurrent operation. two or more operations performed at the same time (or within a give interval). 
control operation. control function. an operation that controls the recording or processing or transmission of interpretation of data. a control operation started the data processing.
dyadic operation. an operation on exactly two operands. 
fixed-cycle operation. an operation that is completed in a specified number of regularly timed execution cycles. 
logic operation. logical operation. an operation that follows the rules of symbolic logic. 
monadic operation. unary operation. an operation with exactly one operand. 
multiplex operation. an operation in which two or more activities are interleaved. 
parallel operation. simultaneous operation. the simultaneous execution of two or more operations. 
printing operation. an operation that controls the printing or display of information. 
carriage return. the operation that prepares for the next character to be printed or displayed as the first character on a line. 
line feed. the operation that prepares for the next character to be printed or displayed on the next line. 
new line. the operation that prepares for the next character to be printed or displayed as the first character on the next line. 
search. lookup. an operation that determines whether one or more of a set of items has a specified property. they wrote a program to do a table lookup.
serial operation. sequential operation. consecutive operation. the sequential execution of operations one after another. 
sort. sorting. an operation that segregates items into groups according to a specified criterion. the bottleneck in mail delivery it the process of sorting.
synchronous operation. operations that are initiated predictably by a clock. 
threshold operation. an operation performed on operands in order to obtain the value of a threshold function. 
majority operation. a threshold operation in which each operand is 0 or 1; output is 1 if and only if more than half the operands have the value 1. 
priority processing. data processing in which the operations performed are determined by a system of priorities. 
background processing. backgrounding. the execution of low priority programs while higher priority programs are not using the processing system. 
foreground processing. foregrounding. the execution of a program that preempts the use of the processing system. 
real-time processing. real-time operation. data processing fast enough to keep up with an outside process. 
serial processing. sequential processing by two or more processing units. 
word processing. rapid and efficient processing (storage and printing) of linguistic data for composition and editing. 
development. developing. processing a photosensitive material in order to make an image visible. the development and printing of his pictures took only two hours.
underdevelopment. (photography) inadequate processing of film resulting in inadequate contrast. 
refining. refinement. purification. the process of removing impurities (as from oil or metals or sugar etc.). 
rectification. (chemistry) the process of refinement or purification of a substance by distillation. 
vulcanization. vulcanisation. process of treating rubber or rubberlike materials with sulphur at great heat to improve elasticity and strength or to harden them.
