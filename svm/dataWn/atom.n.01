atom. (physics and chemistry) the smallest component of an element having the chemical properties of the element. 
carbon atom. an atom of carbon. 
free radical. radical. an atom or group of atoms with at least one unpaired electron; in the body it is usually an oxygen molecule than has lost an electron and will stabilize itself by stealing an electron from a nearby molecule. in the body free radicals are high-energy particles that ricochet wildly and damage cells.
hydrogen atom. an atom of hydrogen. 
acidic hydrogen. acid hydrogen. a hydrogen atom in an acid that forms a positive ion when the acid dissociates. 
deuterium. heavy hydrogen. an isotope of hydrogen which has one neutron (as opposed to zero neutrons in hydrogen). 
isotope. one of two or more atoms with the same atomic number but with different numbers of neutrons. 
deuterium. heavy hydrogen. an isotope of hydrogen which has one neutron (as opposed to zero neutrons in hydrogen). 
radioisotope. a radioactive isotope of an element; produced either naturally or artificially. 
iodine-125. light radioactive isotope of iodine with a half-life of 60 days; used as a tracer in thyroid studies and as a treatment for hyperthyroidism. 
iodine-131. heavy radioactive isotope of iodine with a half-life of 8 days; used in a sodium salt to diagnose thyroid disease and to treat goiter. 
label. a radioactive isotope that is used in a compound in order to trace the mechanism of a chemical reaction. 
tracer. (radiology) any radioactive isotope introduced into the body to study metabolism or other biological processes. 
monad. (chemistry) an atom having a valence of one.
