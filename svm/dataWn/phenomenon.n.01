resonance. an excited state of a stable particle causing a sharp maximum in the probability of absorption of electromagnetic radiation. 
magnetic resonance. resonance of electrons or atoms or molecules or nuclei to radiation frequencies as a result of space quantization in a magnetic field. 
nuclear magnetic resonance. NMR. proton magnetic resonance. resonance of protons to radiation in a magnetic field. 
nuclear resonance. the resonance absorption of a gamma ray by a nucleus identical to the nucleus that emitted the gamma ray. 
surface tension. a phenomenon at the surface of a liquid caused by intermolecular forces. 
capillarity. capillary action. a phenomenon associated with surface tension and resulting in the elevation or depression of liquids in capillaries. 
interfacial tension. interfacial surface tension. surface tension at the surface separating two non-miscible liquids. 
syzygy. the straight line configuration of 3 celestial bodies (as the sun and earth and moon) in a gravitational system. 
transparency. transparence. permitting the free passage of electromagnetic radiation. 
turbulence. turbulency. unstable flow of a liquid or gas. 
rip. riptide. tide rip. crosscurrent. countercurrent. a stretch of turbulent water in a river or the sea caused by one current flowing into or across another current. 
pulsation. a periodically recurring phenomenon that alternately increases and decreases some quantity.
