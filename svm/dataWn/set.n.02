set. (mathematics) an abstract collection of numbers or symbols. the set of prime numbers is infinite.
diagonal. (mathematics) a set of entries in a square matrix running diagonally either from the upper left to lower right entry or running from the upper right to lower left entry. 
domain. the set of values of the independent variable for which a function is defined. 
field. (mathematics) a set of elements such that addition and multiplication are commutative and associative and multiplication is distributive over addition and there are two elements 0 and 1. the set of all rational numbers is a field.
scalar field. a field of scalars. 
group. mathematical group. a set that is closed, associative, has an identity element and every element has an inverse. 
Abelian group. commutative group. a group that satisfies the commutative law. 
subgroup. (mathematics) a subset (that is not empty) of a mathematical group. 
intersection. a point or set of points common to two or more geometric configurations. 
origin. the point of intersection of coordinate axes; where the values of the coordinates are all zero. 
interval. a set containing all points (or all real numbers) between two given endpoints. 
closed interval. bounded interval. an interval that includes its endpoints. 
open interval. unbounded interval. an interval that does not include its endpoints. 
sub-interval. an interval that is included in another interval. 
locus. the set of all points or lines that satisfy or are determined by specific conditions. the locus of points equidistant from a given point is a circle.
Mandelbrot set. a set of complex numbers that has a highly convoluted fractal boundary when plotted; the set of all points in the complex plane that are bounded under a certain mathematical iteration. 
mathematical space. topological space. (mathematics) any set of points that satisfy a set of postulates of some kind. assume that the topological space is finite dimensional.
manifold. a set of points such as those of a closed surface or an analogue in three or more dimensions. 
metric space. a set of points such that for every pair of points there is a nonnegative real number called their distance that is symmetric and satisfies the triangle inequality. 
Euclidean space. a space in which Euclid's axioms and definitions apply; a metric space that is linear and finite-dimensional. 
Hilbert space. a metric space that is linear and complete and (usually) infinite-dimensional. 
null space. a space that contains no points; and empty space. 
subspace. a space that is contained within another space. 
null set. a set that is empty; a set with no members. 
solution. root. the set of values that give a true statement when substituted into an equation. 
subset. a set whose members are members of another set; a set contained within another set. 
universal set. (mathematics) the set that contains all the elements or objects involved in the problem under consideration. all other sets are subsets of the universal set.
